    <div class="panel">
        <img src="Comic\Farm\1.jpg" alt="Scene 1 - The Sky Lights Up">
        <p class="caption"> A small village in northern India. Night has fallen.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Rajesh (whispering): Amma, look at the sky… have you ever seen colors like this? <br>
Amma: (crosses herself) In all my years, never. It feels like the gods are angry."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <img src="Comic\Farm\2.jpg" alt="Scene 2 - The Trouble Begins">
        <p class="caption">Next morning, in the wheat fields.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">Rajesh (frustrated): Why won’t this machine start? Yesterday it was working fine!
Neighbor Farmer: Mine too! The GPS is acting crazy. The water pump keeps shutting off. Something is wrong with the power."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="panel">
        <img src="Comic\Farm\3.jpg" alt="Scene 3 - Rajesh Confides in Amma">
        <p class="dialogue">"Rajesh: Amma, everything’s failing—my tractor, my pump, even my phone’s GPS. How can I water the crops on time? If this continues, the harvest will be ruined.
<br>Amma: In our day, we read the skies, not the screens. But now… you young ones depend on these machines. Perhaps the Sun itself is angry."</p>

    <div class="panel">
        <img src="Comic\Farm\4.jpg" alt="The Scientist Arrives">
        <p class="dialogue">"Hold on, Aether-7… come back to life."</p>

    <div class="panel">
        <img src="Comic\Farm\5.jpg" alt=" Scene 4 (Cont.)">
        <p class="caption">That evening, the village gathers.</p>
        <p class="dialogue">"Rajesh (standing up): So the Sun is not just giving us light… it can take away our tools too? <br>
Meera: Exactly. The Sun feeds your crops, but it can also shake the systems we’ve built to depend on it"</p>
    </div>

    <div class="end-note">
        <h2>The Lesson</h2>
        <p>Space weather reminds us that even small bursts from the Sun can ripple through our technology and lives. 
        Through resilience and teamwork, humanity learns to adapt — one storm at a time.</p>
